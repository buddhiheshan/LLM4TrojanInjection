Design: dma.sv
Vulnerability ID: T3
Model: gpt-4.1
Attempts: 1

Explanation:
A synthesizable denial-of-service hardware Trojan was inserted by adding a persistent disable latch. After a secret sequence on the control.go.q signal (e.g., four rising edges), the Trojan disables the internal gated clock, halting all core DMA logic forever.

Trigger:
The trigger is four rising edges on reg2hw.control.go.q (such as toggling the go bit four times), after which the trojan_disabled signal permanently disables the clock gating enable.

Payload:
Once triggered, the clock enable to all internal flops is held low, preventing all normal state updates and causing the module to become permanently non-functional, i.e., a denial of service.

Taxonomy:
Insertion phase: Design  
Abstraction level: Register-transfer level  
Activation mechanism: Triggered internally (specific input signal sequence on go bit)  
Effects: denial of service  
Location: DMA controller main functional core, via clock gating logic  
Characteristics: Localized, Small, Functional Trojan
